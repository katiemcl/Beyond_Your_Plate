you can find the live website here: [https://soc-409.herokuapp.com/](https://soc-409.herokuapp.com/)


## locating pages

due to the very nested structure of Django/Python projects, finding files of interest is a little tricky

HTML pages are located in psite/prof/templates/prof

the CSS stylesheet is located in psite/static/css

images are located is located in psite/static/images

if you are interested in any of the backend files or have any specific questions about the code, please contact me at kjm3@princeton.edu


## technical stack

to create this website, I used Django and Python for the backend and HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend.

if you would like to create your own website using this same stack, Corey Schafer provides a great step by step tutorial series on this [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p&ab_channel=CoreySchafer).

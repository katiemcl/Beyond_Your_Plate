    <p class="section_text">
        This project started as an exploration of where our food comes from. As college students, this question is 
        often left unanswered when we eat at the dining halls or are served food at local restaurants. With a 
        shared interest in our relationship to the environment, data contextualiziations to drive community
        collective action, and food, we sought to explore the food-agri supply chain and the journey that food
        makes to get to our plate.
    </p>

    <p class="section_text">
        Through our conversations with local restaurants in our community, we quickly saw that sustainability and 
        locality were sensitive and politicized topics, especially with such large infrastructures outside of an 
        individualâ€™s control. Although this was a final project for a class cross-listed in the Computer Science 
        department, we decided against designing a technical solution. Because the landscape was so complicated, we 
        looked towards growing connection and establishing understanding between members of the community and our food. 
        We therefore decided to design a food event to reveal these complications and encourage active community 
        reflection as a step towards action.

    <h2 class="section_header">our hopes</h2>

    <p class="section_text">
        This website documents how we used a place setting and interactive narration to visceralize our learnings 
        from the stories that were shared with us. We hope that by sharing our journey, we spark conversations and bring 
        stories of your favorite local restaurants to life. If you do hold an event like this (or one with your own spin),
        please reach out and share! We can't wait to be inspired by your community's conversations about community
        relationships and food systems beyond your plate.

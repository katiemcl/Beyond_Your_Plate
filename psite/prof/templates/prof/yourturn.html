        You read more about our event with Lynn and Sakura Express in Princeton (and if you haven't 
        read about it yet, <a class="link" href="{% url 'workshop' %}">see here</a>). 
        We hope that by sharing these materials with you, you can use these as a guide to starting 
        conversations and hosting your own event about food with local restauarants in your community.

        üí° Helpful Tips
    </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Recording: ask for permission to voice record your interview so that you can be fully present in the conversation</li>
            <li>Compensation: Before ending the interview, ask if there is anything you can do in return for them giving you their time. 
                This is time that they could have spent working or relaxing, but instead they spent it with you!</li>
